Coursework 1a:

To build a simple logistic regression classifier to recognise cat pictures from non-cat pictures.

The basic architecture of a learning algorithm is built to train an Artificial Neural Network, including:
1) Initialising the parameters and hyperparameters.
2) Calculating the cost function and its gradient.
3) Using an optimisation algorithm to tune the parameters. In this case, the gradient descent algorithm.
