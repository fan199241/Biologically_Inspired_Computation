# Biologically_Inspired_Computation
Courseworks for Biologically Inspired Computation course in Heriot-Watt University.

Coursework 1a:

To build a simple logistic regression classifier to recognise cat pictures from non-cat pictures. The basic architecture of a learning algorithm is built to train an Artificial Neural Network, including:
1) Initialising the parameters and hyperparameters.
2) Calculating the cost function and its gradient.
3) Using an optimisation algorithm to tune the parameters. In this case, the gradient descent algorithm.

Dataset:
1) Training set: trainCats.h5
2) Test set: testCats.h5

Coursework 1b:

To extend Coursework 1a logistic regression classifier into a more complex topology using, the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The coursework also needs to build a more advanced architecture for the neural network. Specifically:
1) Deal with a multi-class classification problem.
2) Use units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh.
3) Modify the previous algorithm in order to include hidden layers.
4) Implement a regularisation method.
5) Compare some configurations in terms of performance (accuracy/time).
6) Use a test dataset to measure the generality of your model.

Dataset:
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset created by Zalando that consists of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each sample image is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.
